  \opening{Dear Person,}

  This is an invoice for the following items:

  \begin{invoice}{0.0}% No VAT?
    % Add your items here (description, price, count)
		\Fee{Work per hour}{60}{1.75}
		\Fee{Silver Sponsoring}{500}{1}
  \end{invoice}

  Payment terms: 30 days.

	You can write more stuff here. Like lorem ipsum dolor etc. Which is not
	actually Latin, by the way! It just looks like it is, but it is not. But at
	least it fills the necessary space!

  \closing{\\Best regards,}

\end{letter}
