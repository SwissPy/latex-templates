\begin{letter}{Max Muster\\Musterstrasse 42\\8640 Rapperswil}

  \opening{Dear Person,}

	This is a letter.

	You can write more stuff here. Like lorem ipsum dolor etc. Which is not
	actually Latin, by the way! It just looks like it is, but it is not. But at
	least it fills the necessary space!

  \closing{\\Best regards,}

\end{letter}
